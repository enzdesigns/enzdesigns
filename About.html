								<strong>Oracle (September 2003 – 2019)</strong><br>
								<strong>Senior Manager, Functional Technical Architect Smart UX. Oracle (2015 - 2019)</strong><br>
								 As a first adopter of AI technology, I initiated and pioneered the concept of intelligent UX which aimed to use AI to reduce cognitive load and improve decision making.  The ‘Smart UX platform’, used simple rules, NLU, and ontology to predict user intent and automate flows.  The rules were fully extensible and can be leveraged and enhanced by machine learning. This platform was used to prioritize notifications, tasks, and suggestions, as well as track incomplete tasks to ensure maximum user productivity.
								 <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
									<li>Defined the road map for the product proof of concept in collaboration with scientists and front/back-end engineers. Identified the product requirements and wrote the use cases for the CRM, Service, Self Service, and Project Portfolio Management set of products.  These product requirements formed the basis for the logic and rules for the smart UX platform proof of concept.</li>
									ß	<li>Led competitive analysis, ran focus groups, and conducted customer interviews to identify what users see as ‘smartness’ as well as anticipate their implicit needs.</li>
										<li>Analyzed and evaluated the technical feasibility of the UI design specs created by the design team.  Identified and prioritized features in the context of Oracle technology and the database structure. Recognized and logged enhancement requests for the UI shell and component behavior.</li>
										<li>My team has provided the functional spec for all the components that required “Smartness” – Context-based Notifications, suggestions, and tracking progress.</li>
										<li>Reviewed the code, logged bugs, and worked closely with middleware, product development, and design teams to provide alternative design solutions in cases where coding the original designs within the timeline was not feasible.</li>
										<li>Collaborated with PMs and engineers across Oracle enterprise solutions to identify relevant user stories and coordinate the adoption and implementation efforts for the first release of Integrating “Smartness”.</li>
										<li>Developed the concept of ‘mini-apps’ to facilitate design updates for commonly used flows and rapidly respond to customer requests. 'Mini apps' are widgets tailored to the completion of a common task flow without entering the app itself. As a stand-alone UI component, this solution was not subject to the implementation constraints and dependencies of the parent app and allowed for flexibility on a rapid timescale.  
									</li>
                                  </ul>
									<strong>Senior Manager Director of Innovations, User Experience, Oracle (2013 – 2015)</strong><br>
										Identifying the need for a group that could respond fast to customers’ needs, and rapidly generate new designs in response to market changes, I built a team that focused on cross-platform design innovation for applications on the cloud, specifically CRM, Service, and the Information Architecture supporting them.
										<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
					                        <li>Presented at customer activities such as outreach events, early adopters, and the Oracle Usability Advisory Board forums, where I facilitated a stronger connection between design concepts and industry requirements.</li>
											<li>Collaborated with marketing and sales to tailor design solutions to rapidly address urgent customer needs and help close deals.</li>
											<li>Created an internal website with short white papers on new designs, as well as animated user journeys. The site intended to increase and support communication between Design, Sales, and Marketing.</li>
											<li>Delivered innovative designs for complex flows to better leverage data in enterprise applications and address customers’ requests. Examples include:</li>
											
											<ul style="list-style-type: '→ ';">
											<li>An alternative way for the use of dynamic tabs in complex solutions such as Oracle Service Center. The new solution increased performance and reduced rendering time to 2 seconds or less.</li>
											<li>A solution for rendering content in complex pages, so that it will appear faster than it is. This solution worked 80% of the time and was very cheap to implement as it did not require redesign.</li>
											<li>A new customer relationship management (CRM) Mobile solution that blends the power of smart analytics with robust data and embedded visualization, enabling quick but thorough decision-making.</li>
											<li>A mobile phone To-Do application for sales managers. The app syncs with the user calendar, contacts, and physical location, to suggest sales opportunities and support them throughout their day.</li>
											<li>Context-based design guidelines for wearable-watch. Provided designs for CRM, service, and supply chain management (SCM).</li>
											</ul>
										</ul>

										<strong>Senior Group Manager, User Experience Oracle (2009 - 2013)</strong><br>
										As a senior manager, I spearheaded my team’s transition towards designing mobile and desktop solutions for three lines of products: Fusion Project Portfolio Management, Fusion Resource Management, and Fusion Governance Risk and Compliance. These products were part of Fusion, a new solution created from the ground up based on the latest database technology, using Web 2.0 and AJAX.
										<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
											<li>Developed a UX Agile process to meet the fast-paced development methodology style. This process was standardized and applied to the development process across the entire product suite of Oracle Applications.</li>

											<li>Took part in the Early Adopter for Fusion program, which included presenting and training of selected customers.</li>
											<li>Helped facilitate a stronger connection between design concepts and industry requirements through involvement in the Oracle Usability Advisory Board, a forum of selected customer executives across the world that meets every quarter to discuss usability topics concerning Oracle products</li>
										</ul>
									
										<strong>Manager, User Experience Oracle (2006 – 2009)</strong><br>
										As a group manager, I developed a global team that provided design support for a new set of Oracle applications. My main challenge was to build a team that was strong and flexible enough to meet the fluctuating behavior of the market under an aggressive schedule while using a waterfall methodology for developing the product.
										<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
											<li>Led the effort towards setting the level and scope of design support, I participated in the process of setting the specifications led by the Strategy team.</li>
											<li>Took part in the creation and review of the business and functional development documentation.</li>
											<li>Towards code completion dates, we led reviews and logged bugs to ensure compatibility with release standards.</li>
										</ul>

										<strong>Team Lead, Principal Interaction Design Engineer. Oracle (2003 – 2006)</strong><br>

										Led the Design and Usability efforts for the Business Intelligence Analytic applications.
										
										My main responsibilities included allocating resources and planning for each release, leading the design for the new generation of pure HTML Analytics applications, and participating in the process of evolving the Oracle and PeopleSoft Budgeting products into one integrated solution.
										
										<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
										<li>Participated in the preliminary application specification reviews with the product management team.</li>
										<li>Provided alternative mockups that resulted in a Visio or XML prototype for each component.</li>
										<li>Coordinated review sessions between Development, PM, and Tech Writers to approve designs</li>
										<li>Built the Intern program for interaction designers, a 6 to 12-month program that allowed us to train and identify candidates for full-time positions in Oracle.</li>
