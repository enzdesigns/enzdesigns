							<h1>My theory of design</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Title_My_Theory_Design.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My theory of design centers on storytelling. Looking to stories as a guide opens up a new world beyond requirements and top-down design. As design leaders, I believe that stories are our best method to advocate for a truly user-centric approach. To that end it is crucial that we empower our teams to develop empathy for the user, thinking about the experience they build beyond the UI that they design.</p>
							<h3>Storytelling to empower creativity</h3>
							<p>Designing based on a story was a skill that I developed during my role managing Core Innovations at Oracle. Since then, I have used this skill both to support the evolution of products and as a tool to help designers evaluate and improve their own work.</p>
							<p>As the leader of Core Innovations, I was charged with exploring new technologies and how they may impact the experience of the Oracle cloud products as well as help product teams reinvent highly trafficked flows. In this role, I did not always have strategy support to articulate the problem, or PM to help set clear requirements. It was up to me to identify who to work with, problems worth solving and ideas to think through, with a time limit of not more than 3 weeks from start to finish of the project.</p>
							<p>To inspire the team, I used to write a short script that described a ‘day in the life’ of the customer, and how the product or technology will play a part in it. I felt that it is important to relate to the user beyond their persona, and really understand their motivations, as well as where they may be distracted when interacting with Oracle Claude products. Below are three examples to show the results of using this technique: (1) Procurements Negotiations, (2) Government Risk and Compliance, and (3) CRM Sales Funnel.</p>
								<h6>(1)Procurements Negotiations - using a story to get into the users’ shoes:</h6>
								<p>When I chose to take on the “Monitor Negotiations” flow in Oracle’s Procurement product, it wasn’t because the original design team hadn’t gone through a robust design process. They had created user personas, task flow schema and had followed requirements for the product, but users were not excited. Something was missing.</p>
								<p>We started our three-week design sprint by talking to customers and stakeholders to understand how they used our product within their procurement process. To bring those insights to life, we developed a story focusing on the negotiation day, highlighting managing a negotiation once it goes live, and sharing the process with executives in real time.</p>
								<p>We needed to create a design that allowed for multiple types of views and interaction types. It had to be capable of displaying an ongoing negotiation on large monitors in a room full of people, while also being able to scale to provide the user with ‘behind the scenes’ access so they could monitor trends and manage the suppliers and negotiations. In the new experience, we decided to animate analytics, integrating it into the user flow. Showing just the right amount of information at the right time allowed the user to monitor active negotiations, focus on what was most important and take action.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Redesign_Procurement.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
							<h6>(2)Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) - Simplifications of Data</h6>
								<p>The GRC user was expected to analyze large sets of data in search of action items. While the UI was very strong in terms of conveying the integrity of the data, the execution relied too much on the user doing the right thing at the right time. Meanwhile, the user was overloaded with the responsibility of finding what needed to be done.</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/GRC redesign.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In our attempt to simplify the experience, we built the user story, asking our users, “How does a typical day look like for you?”, ‘What tasks do you typically do? What data is most important to you? Why?’ Based on the information we received, we created analytic summaries that acted as filters, providing an overview of the data in terms of what needs to be done, the health of the data, etc. The tasks were now embedded in the analytics. For example, one of the filters included answers to questions such as ‘how many tasks do I have waiting assignment?’ clicking on this analytic, would filter the list to show only pending tasks. A heat map displaying the hierarchy of the data helped the user visually “feel” the distribution of the data and its meaning and together it helped the user assume control over the data.</p>
							
  							<h6>(3) CRM Sale Rep - using a story to align with the user’s mental model</h3>
							<p>A Sales Representative's main role is to ensure a smooth sales process. They use CRM solutions to manage their customers' relationships, as well as monitor and manage the deals they oversee. Most Sales Reps are paid based on their ability to meet their quarterly sales quotas, so they use CRM strategically to ensure customer satisfaction while at the same time optimizing their bonus.</p>
							<p>Talking with Sales Reps I was struck by how chaotic their day is, how much information they tended to keep in their head, and how strategic they were when choosing when to do what.</p>
							<p>There are many CRM products, but in conversations that I had, regardless of the tools they used, Sales Reps found the interaction convoluted even when the UI and workflows were customized to their company’s processes. They did not find the products useful to receive or manage information and used it mostly to document their efforts so that they could ‘get paid correctly’ at the end of the quarter.</p>
							<p>Inspired to improve the customer experience, I put together a small team of designers to rethink the problem. After a few Needs & Wants tests, and brainstorming sessions, we identified that the problem was not with the ‘job to be done’, but with how the information was displayed. The customary view of a dashboard with analytics and tables describing opportunity size, stage, etc, was convenient enough to update information about the opportunities, but it did not support the strategizing that was so essential for the success of the role.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/CRM_Before_Redesign.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I hypothesized that by changing the focus of how we showed the information we could allow the user to manage the data the way they thought of it and thereby tailor the tool to their own personal story. I wanted to think about the solution from a different perspective and asked the team to recreate the table so that it focused on the funnel pipeline. This meant reorganizing the table by the ‘sale stage’ of each opportunity, ranging from deal discovery to closing, instead of by the opportunities themselves.</p>
							<p>We decided to keep the original view and allow the user to easily switch to see the same information from different perspectives. (1) to help see the big picture, we designed a visualization view of the data. In this view, each opportunity was a circle. The size and color of the circle correlated with the deal size and the probability of closing the deal. We expected this view to be preferred when the Sales Rep was in transit using a tablet, as well as during bi-quarterly reviews with their manager as it helped them demo the health of their portfolio with minimal effort. (2) We added a card view, where each opportunity was a card. Sales reps used this view to quickly update and manage their opportunities, helping them make decisions in context. (3) Finally, we created a timeline View, to help the sales rep analyze what worked and what did not over time.</p>
							<p>The enhanced solution that was created based on the user mental model, scored high in user satisfaction and time to task, even when the task was strategic in nature.</p>

							<h3>Using stories to unlock requirements</h3>
								<p>Tenable Cloud Security, was a greenfield product trying to address a growing need in the market for a solution that will show the user all of their accounts across multiple cloud services in one view. I asked our researcher to help us understand (1) who can benefit from such a service, (2) why would they care for it, and (3) how it would fit into their existing workflow jobs to be done (see figure 1, for ‘Emotional Journey Map’). It was 2020 and running research in the early days of the pandemic was a very big challenge. People were reserved. Conducting remote shadowing sessions was challenging and most often, rejected. Our very talented researcher creatively collected the different puzzle pieces for the user persona and the ‘Emotional Journey Map’ from which we learned that monitoring accounts’ health is a big part of what the user wishes to do.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cloud_Security_Emotional_Map.jpg" alt="" /></span>

<p>Excited about testing the new technology we had developed for retrieving all of a user’s Cloud accounts, PM set our design requirement around showing users a list of these accounts. The designer got to work iterating on potential solutions for displaying the list.
</p>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cloud_Security_attempt.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>If we had gone straight to usability testing whether designs satisfied the product requirement, it would have probably passed. The design allowed the user to successfully count how many accounts they have on each cloud service, and if they were to ask whether they found it helpful, they would have said a ‘strong yes’. The design alternatives addressed the requirements, but
     
	were not created to answer “what will the user do with the information, once they have it.” Without an answer to that question, we could not predict whether the solution would be useful. This is where designing for requirements can lead to bad outcomes – solutions can look good through usability testing, only to fall flat on adoption because no one asked the right questions. Instead of calling it done, once we had designs that satisfied requirements, I decided to zoom out and advocate for the user at the requirement level.</p>
	<p>Inspired by the book ‘Stories that Stick’ by Kindra Hall, I decided to work with the PM executive leading the product to try and build an experience story, instead of a list of requirements. I wanted his help in changing the general requirement “The business is telling us that our users will be grateful if we will list all of their accounts on the cloud” into a story that UX can build an experience for.</p>
	<p>I used our weekly 1:1 to ask him to help me explore this new technique and see if it would lead to a better-designed product. That leader – who very much believed in UX and having a strong user-centric process – was a bit skeptical and said: “Natti, I am sorry, I know what we tell you is not much, but this is all we know at the moment. Once the product is released, we will be able to observe the users and decide on a path forward,” yet he agreed to give it a try. The result left us both amazed by how easy it was to translate a relatively ambiguous requirement into an experience that would inspire the team to build a loveable product users love.</p>
<p>The activity took 15 minutes and included 4 simple questions that the product leader needed to answer spontaneously:</p>
 <ol>

	<li>Name the user</li>
	<li>State the day of the week this story will take place</li>
	<li>Describe in very few words what this person will typically do during that day of the week</li>
	<li>Describe what happened that day that made the user happy to have the product “Cloud Security” available to them</li>
 </ol>
<p>Answering those questions resulted in this story:<br>
	<strong>“It’s Tuesday. As on every Tuesday morning, Jennifer plans the work for the rest of the week by logging into the Tenable Cloud and checking the status of all her accounts to see what changed and which accounts have the highest exposure. She takes a sip of her coffee when she notices that failed findings on AWS-west-1b, increased significantly! This is one of her top accounts! It has almost 200 hundred resources, and the score is bad...
	This will be one of those days she mumbles to herself as she sets her slack to 'do not disturb' and starts the investigation into what went wrong. She will now go into the account to learn what has changed and identify the cause for this increase in exposure.”</strong><br>
	In a week's time, the designers changed the experience from a set of BI on top of a flat table to an intentional experience that focused on ‘what changed’ allowing the user to quickly react to issues and trends (see figure 7)</p>			
								
	<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cloud_Security_Redesign.jpg" alt="" /></span>

	<p>Why did it work? Starting with the name and day for the user story helped transfer a fictional persona into someone relatable, priming the PM to give more grounded answers to the important questions. When asking questions 3 and 4, I already had the name and a day for the user in the story, and that helped transfer the fictional persona into a more relatable one. Answering question 3 gave us the answer to ‘what’ the user will do with the app. The answer to question 4 told us ‘why’ and that was enough to inspire the team to focus on the experience and building the ‘how’.</p>
<h3>Storytelling to empower designers</h3>
<p>Inspiring others to tell stories can unlock requirements no one would otherwise think of. I have used this “relatable story” technique with designers on other greenfield products, asking them to write a short ‘thank you’ letter from a fictional user point of view, then use that letter to demo the design they created. The designers could have written the story themselves, validating it with the cross functional members of the products team, or written it collaboratively. More often than not, the designer found that the design created did not stand the test of the story, which was a good way to test the value of the product. It also motivated the designer to be more empathetic to the user’s needs if a redesign was needed.</p>
