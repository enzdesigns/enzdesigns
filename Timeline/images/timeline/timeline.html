			<h2>6:30AM</h2>

			<h2>7:45AM</h2>
			<span>On his way to the office, John stops at Starbucks to fuel on coffee. He opens Oracle Mobile on his phone, and sees analytics warning him that he is too low on his quota.That's odd he thinks, knowing that a lot of his deals are in the last stages of closer. He taps on the infolet to see a list of his top opportunities and notices that AL and PT, two of his leading opportunities are staled in the system. He closes the warning, knowing that he can always open it later on his tablet to get more information. </span>

			<h2>7:50AM</h2>
			<span>The coffee line is long, so he takes good use of the time and understand a bit better why he got this quota warning. Seeing the warning icon on his pipeline, John understands that there are some issues with the opportunities on the Negotiation stage. He thinks, and taps on the icon to see stage related notifications. John's name is called - his coffee is ready. </span>

			<h2>8:40AM</h2>
			<span>It is now 8:40am. Almost time for his 9am pipeline review with his manager. John opens his laptop and logs into the Oracle CRM. He sees the same set of infolets as on his phone earlier this morning. He clicks on the quote infolet to get a better feel about how his opportunities are doing. He clicks on the Multi Site Merge opportunity that been stalled in the system and create an appointment with Marla, his contact.

			<h2>8:42AM</h2>

			<h2>9:00AM</h2>
			<span> John's Manager looks at the visualization of John opportunities, and realizes that a lot of deals are about to be closed in the next 6 weeks, and they'd better make sure the factory in China is set to handle it. He also notices that there are not a lot of new things coming into Johnâ€™s cue. Quickly scanning the visualization he can see that there are few low win opportunities, and one midsize deal that may end up working, and he encourages John to develop more opportunities to work on.

			<h2>11:10AM</h2>
			<span> John is on his way to the city for a lunch meeting with a customer. His watch buzzes with a notification that a new 'Hot' Lead has been qualified by an inside sales rep and assigned to him. The potential deal size is very profitable, and the main contact he needs to reach is located very close to his lunch location. Thus John gives her a call, saying that he is in town and schedules to meet with her once he is done with his meeting. As it happen to be, she is going to China next week, so good thing John got to know about this lead while in the area so he could quickly respond to get things started.

			<h2>11:54AM</h2>
			<span> John's company's server is down and it's causing a real issue for the customer he is about to meet for lunch, as their performance will slow down dramatically. John quickly calls the POC in the support team to get an update on the issue and how it been address. 20 minutes after the customer logged the SR, John goes into the meeting, fully prepared to talk about the issue, reassuring the customer that fixing this issue is a high priority for his business, that he already contacted the support team, and that they are cranking through it. He promises to get back to them with ETA within two hours. 'Your business is important to us, and we are doing everything we can to fix this issue immediately'.
