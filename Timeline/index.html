			<span>Dan Foreman takes the train to SF. While on the train he captures his impression from the meeting earlier that day: "Meeting with John went well".  </span>
			<h2>11:05AM</h2>
			<span>Few minutes later, Dan remembers that since the meeting took place over breakfast, he should expense it. He captures "Met with John for breakfast and it was $30". </span>

<!-- 			<h2>12:00PM</h2>
			<span>Arriving at SF, Dan realizes that he has time before his next meeting, and decides to grab a quick lunch.
			</span> -->
			<h2>12:15PM</h2>
			<span>As he grabs lunch, Dan looks at the notifications on his phone and notices two new items. His earlier note "Meeting with John went well" shows a system generated suggestion to log a Call Report. Dan Accepts the suggestion, which creates the report. With one tap he is done.  
			<br><br>
			
			Next he opens the second notification. This one is a reminder about his breakfast expense. The system suggests an expense form that is automatically filled with content, based on the capture and the time and date it was entered. Dan checks that all the information is correct and taps on "Accept" to generate the report.

			<h2>12:50PM</h2>

The SR states that the server is down and is causing a real issue. Dan quickly calls the support contact on the account to get an update on the issue and how it is being addressed.</span>

			<h2>1:00PM</h2>
			<span>Dan goes into the meeting fully prepared to talk about the issue, reassuring the customer that fixing this problem is a high priority for his business, that he has already contacted the support team, and that they are cranking through it. He promises to get back to them with an ETA within two hours: "Your business is important to us, and we are doing everything we can to fix this issue asap."</span>

			<h2>3:10PM</h2>
			<span>Dan takes a quick look at his capture summarizing his 1pm meeting and the system suggestions to create a Call Report and update the Win Percentage for the Green Server opportunity. He wants to put a bit more thought into it, as well as check the status of the SR. He will deal with it later once back in the office.

			<h2>4:30PM</h2>
			<span> Back in the office, Dan uses his laptop to log into his Oracle applications. He sees few recommended actions on the banner view, and clicks on the bell icon to read notifications. His earlier capture is there reminding him about the outcome of the meeting he had in SF. Now that he has a bit more time, he can take the required steps to follow up on open items.
