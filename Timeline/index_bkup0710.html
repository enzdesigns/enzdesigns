			<h2>11:00AM</h2>
			<span>Dan Foreman takes the train to SF. It has been a crazy morning and he barely made the train rushing out of a meeting. As he settles down in his seat, he takes out his phone and quickly captures his impression from the meeting: "Meeting with John went well".</span>
			<h2>11:05AM</h2>
			<span>He checks his emails and remembers that he needs to expense the breakfast he just had with John. He uses his phone to capture:" Met with John for breakfast and it was $30."</span>

			<h2>12:00PM</h2>
			<span>Arriving at SF, Dan realizes that he has time before his next meeting, and decides to grab a quick lunch.
			</span>
			<h2>12:10PM</h2>
			<span>As he enjoys his salad, Dan looks at the notification on his phone and sees two new notifications. He recognizes the first notification as the note he captured on the train. He taps on it, reads his note "Meeting with John went well" and notices that the system has generated a suggestion for him to quickly log a Call Report. Dan Accepts the suggestion. With one tap he is done.  Dan thinks to himself: "Nice. That was easy". 
			<br><br>
			
			Next he opens the second notification. This one is a reminder about his breakfast expense. The system suggests an auto-filled form, based on the content of Dan's capture, and the time it was created. Dan checks that all the information is correct and taps on "Accept" to generate the report.

			<h2>12:45PM</h2>
			<span>Taking a quickly look at his phone Dan notices a notification about his upcoming meeting in 15 minutes. "I'd better get moving", he thinks, clears up his tray and quickly walks toward the meeting location.</span>
			<h2>12:50PM</h2>
			<span>As he arrives at the meeting location he takes one last look at his phone, and sees a new SR alert from the customers he is about to meet on top of his previous meeting reminder. He reads that their server is down and is causing a real issue. He quickly calls the support contact on the account to get an update on the issue and how it is being addressed.</span>

			<h2>What did you just see?</h2>
			1. Sales professionals live life on the go. They do not have the time to stop and drill into applications to be informed.<br><br>
			2. The Smart UX system notices the importance of the new SR in relevance to the upcoming meeting, and decides to give the SR top priority based on the current context. 
			<br><br>
			3. Top priority tasks are surfaced on mobile Home page in the form of Smart Widgets. Smart Widgets provides next best actions from system suggestion that allows users to be informed and complete essential tasks with a few taps on the screen.

			<h2>1:00PM</h2>
			<span>Dan goes into the meeting fully prepared to talk about the issue, reassuring the customer that fixing this problem is a high priority for his business, that he has already contacted the support team, and that they are cranking through it. He promises to get back to them with an ETA within two hours: "Your business is important to us, and we are doing everything we can to fix this issue asap."</span>

			<h2>3:10PM</h2>
			<span>On the train back to office, Dan uses his phone to check his notifications. One of the notifications is his capture from a bit over an hour ago. He takes a quick look and decides to dismiss the system quick action suggestions to create a Call Report and update Win Percentage for the Green Server opportunity. He wants to put a bit more thought into it, as well as to check the status of the SR. He will deal with it later once back in the office.
